# XBOW Autonomous Engagement Workflow

This workflow orchestrates the XBOW autonomous testing platform. It uses the `xbow-integration`
skill to launch an AI swarm against a target, wait for the assessment to complete,
and retrieve only the confirmed vulnerabilities (zero false positives), followed by
broadcasting the results.

> **Note to Agent:** XBOW agents are non-destructive, but you must still verify the target is explicitly in-scope before launching.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Verify Dependencies Configuration**
   Check that `XBOW_API_KEY` is present in `.env`.
   Check that `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` or `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` are present if broadcasting.

2. **Validate Target Scope**
   Ensure the target URL requested by the user is within the authorized engagement scope.

3. **Launch the Swarm**
   Call `xbow_scan(action: "launch", targetUrl: "<TARGET>")`
   The tool will return a `Scan ID`.

4. **Monitor Assessment**
   Enter a polling loop. Call `xbow_scan(action: "status", scanId: "<ID>")` every 60 seconds
   until the status indicates the scan has completed.

5. **Retrieve Confirmed Findings**
   Once completed, call `xbow_scan(action: "findings", scanId: "<ID>")` to get the list
   of verified vulnerabilities and exploits.

6. **Generate Summary Report**
   Call `xbow_scan(action: "report", scanId: "<ID>")` to generate the Markdown report
   of all evidence.

7. **Broadcast Alert**
   Post a summary alert to `discord` or `telegram`. Include the generated Markdown report
   as an attachment.

   _Example Telegram Alert:_

   ```text
   🏹 **XBOW Assessment Complete**
   **Target:** `api.target.com`
   **Findings:** 3 Confirmed Vulnerabilities (1 High, 2 Medium)
   *Detailed exploit evidence attached.*
   ```
