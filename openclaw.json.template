  // OpenClaw Offensive OS — Full Agent Configuration
  // Copy this to ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json to activate the Red Team Agent.

  // IMPORTANT: The Red Team Agent is fully autonomous — it auto-invokes all tools,
  // runs parallel workflows, and dynamically coordinates specialist sub-agents.
  // You never need to run any commands manually.
